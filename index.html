        <h1> Hi! </h1>
        <h3> I'm Pedro Quintas, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Portugal. </h3>
        <p>
            I'm into nearly everything that is computer or music related.
            In the past I've been a Teacher and Researcher, but I like Software Engineering better because I get to fix problems.
            And fixing problems is pretty cool!
        </p>

                    I work in the Client Runtime team, building the libraries and code that power the frontend of applications built with the OutSystems platform.
                    I mostly work with Javascript, Typescript and a bit of React.
                    Sometimes I also dabble with the Javascript code generation and other backend stuff that is written with C#.

                    I started a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, studying Explainable and Human-Centered AI.
                    My research work focused on how we could make AI algorithms have more impact on non-expert users, in particular to better inform regular people about online misinformation.

                    I got a masters in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Interaction and Visualization and Games.
                    I mostly focused on classes that involved topics related with Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics.
                    For my thesis I worked on an AI capable of turning everyday sounds into pieces of avantgarde music.

                    While there I worked on a visual scripting language to implement the conversation flows of answering bots, and giving those bots Natural Language Processing capabilities, such as understanding a client's intention from an unstructured conversation and reacting to when a client becomes angry by escalating to a human agent.
