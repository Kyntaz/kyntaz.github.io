        <h1> Hi! </h1>
        <h3> I'm Pedro Quintas, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Portugal. </h3>
        <p>
            I'm into nearly everything that is computer or music related.
            In the past I've been a Teacher and Researcher, but I like Software Engineering better because I get to fix problems.
            And fixing problems is pretty cool!
        </p>
